          Toebeans is an application done by on of the senior design groups at UNLV!
          We aim to help local shelters by driving adoption through education, streamlined processes, and visibility.
          As avid animal lovers, each and everyone of us has contribuited toward a better tommorow for the animals here
          within our local community.

          Consider Adopting or Fostering
        </div>

        <div>
          Adopting pets is important because it gives animals in shelters a second chance at a happy, loving life.
          Many pets are abandoned or surrendered through no fault of their own and face uncertain futures in overcrowded
          shelters.
          By adopting, you help reduce the number of animals in need, while also gaining a loyal companion who may have
          been overlooked due to age, breed, or appearance.
          4Adoption also combats the problem of pet overpopulation and can save lives, making it a compassionate choice
          for both pets and people.

        <div class="text-justify">
          TNR stands for Trap-Neuter-Return, a humane method for managing and reducing feral cat populations. It
          involves trapping stray or feral cats,
          having them spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and then returning them to their original location. This process
          prevents further breeding, improves
          the health of the cats, and helps stabilize local populations over time. TNR is a more compassionate
          alternative to euthanasia, as it allows cats to
          continue living in their familiar environment without contributing to the overpopulation problem, while also
          reducing behaviors like mating and
          territorial fighting.
